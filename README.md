Environment variables are self explanatory:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

I use pnpm, npm and yarn should work but this is my preference

```
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

default port is localhost:3000 but you can customize it by appending `-p {port}` to `next start` in the package.json start script

Most information that isn't fetched from github can be customised in the `src/lib/data/` directory
