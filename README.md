Welcome to **slop.sh** â€” my personal site and portfolio.

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Variables

To get started, copy the example environment file and adjust as needed:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

See [.env.example](./.env.example) for reference.

### 2. Install Dependencies

I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), but npm and yarn should work as well:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Running the App

The default port is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
To use a custom port, append `-p {port}` to the `next start` command in your `package.json` scripts.

### 4. Customization

Most information not fetched from API routes can be customized in [`src/lib/data/`](./src/lib/data/).
